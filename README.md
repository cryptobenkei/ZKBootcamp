## Maths Introduction
Some modular arithmetic

1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
What is
a) 4 + 4
b) 3 x 5
c) what is the inverse of 3 ?

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

3. What is
-13 mod 5 ?

## Solution
```bash
# bun hw.ts

Exercise 1
a) result 4 + 4 = 1
b) result 5 * 3 = 1
c) result inv(3)  = 5

Exercise 2
a) Closure = true
b) Associativity = true
c) Identity = true
d) INverse true= true

```
